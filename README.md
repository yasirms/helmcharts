# Helm Charts for Ruby on Rails and Postgres DB 

The helm charts for creating Ruby on Rails weather App. This app uses Ruby on Rils, Postgresql DB and Redis for key/value storage.

The helm charts for Ruby and Postgres use custome images from my personal Repo on Docker. The Redis is using the offical image on Docker hub.
